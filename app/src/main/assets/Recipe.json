      "Name": "gulab jamun",
      "Recipe": "1. Take 1 cup khoya or mawa (200 grams) in a bowl. Soft khoya also known as ‘daap ka khoya’ or ‘chikna khoya’ is used. This is a soft khoya, so it mashes and kneads very well.\n\n2. Mash it very well. There should be no lumps or small bits or pieces in the khoya. You can also grate and then mash the khoya. Do not mash too much. Just mash and proceed with the next step.\n\n3. Then add ¾ cup or 100 grams grated paneer, fine rava (semolina), 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, ¼ teaspoon baking powder and ½ teaspoon cardamom powder to the mashed khoya. \nThere should be no lumps in both the mawa and paneer. If there are lumps, then the texture is not even and smooth. The bits and pieces of mawa or paneer give a bite while eating.\n\n4. Mix well.\n\n5. Add 1 tablespoon milk and gather together to form a dough with milk. Don’t knead. Just gently mix. If you are unable to form balls or if the mixture appears dry, then add a few teaspoons of milk and mix again. Cover the dough and set aside for 30 minutes.\n\nMaking sugar solution\n6. Mix 1.75 cups (250 grams) sugar in 1 cup water.\n\n7. On a medium-low flame, heat the sugar solution till it becomes sticky. You just need to switch off the fire before the syrup reaches a one thread consistency. I have used raw sugar which made the syrup have a dark color.\n\nThe syrup should be sticky and not watery. You can even cook the sugar syrup till it reaches a half-string consistency.\n\n8. Add rose water and stir. Set the sugar solution aside. On cooling, if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then just add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and warm the syrup again. Stir while warming the syrup. The sugar crystals will disappear.\n\nShaping and Frying\n9. After 30 minutes, make small balls from the dough without cracks. Cover the dough balls and set aside.\n10. Heat oil until it is medium-hot. Lower the flame to a medium-low or low and wait for a minute. Then gently place the dough balls in the oil. \nIf in case, the dough balls breaks when frying, then add some more maida (about 1 to 2 tablespoons) to the dough. Mix gently again. Set aside for fifteen minutes. Then later fry. \nYou can also check one small piece before frying the rest of the balls. If it breaks, then use the tip mentioned above.\n\n11. Once they start to have tiny golden spots, keep on rotating them in the oil, so that the balls are evenly browned. Since I was taking the photos, I browned a few of them more.\n\n12. Remove the fried dough balls and then place them on kitchen paper towels to remove extra oil.\n\nSoaking in sugar syrup\n13: Place the hot fried dough balls in the sugar syrup. Continue to fry the rest of the dough balls in batches. Later place them while still hot in the sugar syrup. \n\n14. When all the gulab jamun are placed in the sugar syrup, then keep the whole pan on a low flame for 1 to 2 minutes, till the jamun become soft. Heating helps the jamun to absorb the syrup and become soft. \nThe gulab jamun increases a bit in size. Don’t overcook as then they can break. Use a large pan, so that the fried jamun balls are not overcrowded and you can easily stir them gently while they are simmering.\n\n15. Serve gulab jamun warm or at room temperature. You can also chill them and serve them cold. Garnish them with rose petals or almond slivers.\n",
